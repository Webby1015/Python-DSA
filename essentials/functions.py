def add(a, b):

    return a+b

# two types of calling an functions with arguments


# in first one we write the values in order in which the arguments were declared
print(add(4, 5))
# in second we write the values with their argument names this is helpful when theres a long list of arguments
print(add(b=5, a=4))
